## Notes
The following packages are treated as submodules in APBS:
* Geometric Flow has been moved to it's own <a href="https://github.com/Electrostatics/geoflow_c">repository</a>.
* FETk has been <a href="https://github.com/Electrostatics/FETK">cloned</a> so that we could effect updates.
* PB-SAM Lives <a href="https//github.com/Electrostatics/PB-SAM">here</a>.

Added a <a href="https://gitter.im/Electrostatics/help">chat feature</a> for users. This can also be found from the support tab on <a href="http://poissonboltzmann.org/"></a>.

## KNOWN BUGS
* Travis CI Linux builds are breaking because Geometric Flow relies on C++11 and Travis boxen have an old GCC that does not support C++11. This also and issue for CentOS 5.
* BEM is temporarily disabled due to build issues.
* Geometric Flow build is currently broken on Windows using Visual Studio.
