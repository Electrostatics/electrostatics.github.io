<h5>Bug fixes</h5>

<ul>
    <li>Added a remove_Valist function in Python wrapper files, to fix a memory leak problem in pdb2pka</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in smooth.c: bandwidth iband, jband and kband (in grid units) should be positive integers</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in psize.py: for a pqr file with no ATOM entries but only HETATM entries in it, inputgen.py should still create an APBS input file with reasonable grid lengths</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in Vgrid_integrate: weight w should return to 1.0 after every i, j or k loop is finished</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in routines.c, now runGB.py and main.py in tools/python/ should be working again instead of producing segfault</li>
    <li>Fixed a few bugs in ApbsClient.py.in related to custom-defined APBS Opal service urls, now it should be OK to use custom-defined APBS Opal service urls for PDB2PQR web server installations</li>
</ul>
