Dear APBS and PDB2PQR users --
<p>
 I am happy to announce the release of PDB2PQR 1.7 which includes two major updates:
</p>
<ul>
<li>For PDB2PQR web interface users:  the JMol web interface for APBS calculation visualization has been substantially improved, thanks to help from Bob Hanson.  Those performing APBS calculations via the PDB2PQR web interface now have a much wider range of options for visualizing the output online -- as well as downloading for offline analysis.</li>
<li>For PDB2PQR command-line and custom web interface users:  the Opal service URLs have changed to new NBCR addresses.  Old services hosted at *.wustl.edu addresses have been decommissioned.  Please upgrade ASAP to use the new web service.  Thank you as always to the staff at NBCR for their continuing support of APBS/PDB2PQR web servers and services.</li>
</ul>
