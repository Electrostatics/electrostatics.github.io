<h3 id="pbam">PB-AM: Poisson-Boltzmann Analytical method</h3>

The Poisson-Boltzmann Analytical method was developed in 2006 by <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ct050263p">Lotan, Head-Gordon (2006)</a>. It has been implemented into APBS by Felberg, Brookes and Head-Gordon.

By coarse-graining each molecule in the system into a sphere, the analytical model is able to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann efficiently and accurately.

<h3 id="pbsam">PB-SAM: Poisson-Boltzmann Semi-Analytical method</h3>

The Poisson-Boltzmann Semi-Analytical method was developed in 2010 by <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct100145f">Yap, Head-Gordon (2010)</a>. It has been implemented into APBS by Felberg, Brookes and Head-Gordon.

By coarse-graining each molecule in the system into many overlapping spheres, the semi-analytical model expands on the formalism of the analytical method and is able to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann efficiently and accurately.

<h3 id="tabi">TABI-PB: Treecode-Accelerated Boundary Integral Poisson-Boltzmann method</h3>

The Treecode-Accelerated Boundary Integral Poisson-Boltzmann method (TABI-PB) was developed by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999113002404">Geng, Krasny (2013)</a>. It has been implemented into APBS by Chen and Wilson.

It is implicit Poisson-Boltzmann solver based on well-conditioned boundary integral equations, and with treecode algorithm reduced the computational costs from O(N^2) to O(NlogN).
TABI-PB gives solvation energy, surface potential, and the triangularization generated by MSMS or NanoShaper.
