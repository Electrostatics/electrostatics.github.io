<h3 id="pbam">PB-AM: Poisson-Boltzmann Analytical method</h3>

The Poisson-Boltzmann Analytical method was developed in 2006 by <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ct050263p">Lotan, Head-Gordon (2006)</a>. It has been implemented into APBS by Felberg and Head-Gordon.

By coarse-graining each molecule in the system into a sphere, the analytical model is able to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann efficiently and accurately.

<h3 id="tabi">TABI-PB: Treecode-Acelerated Boundary Integral Poisson-Boltzmann method</h3>

The Treecode-Acelerated Boundary Integral Poisson-Boltzmann method was developed by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999113002404">Geng, Krasny (2013)</a>. 
It is implicit Poisson-Boltzmann solver based on well-conditioned boundary integral equations, and with treecode algorithm reduced the computational costs from O(N^2) to O(NlogN). 
TABI-PB gives solvation energy, surface potential, and the triangularization generated by MSMS or NanoShaper.

The TABI-PB integration with APBS is done by Chen and Wilson.
