<h3 id="pbam">PB-AM: Poisson-Boltzmann Analytical method</h3>

The Poisson-Boltzmann Analytical method was developed in 2006 by <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ct050263p">Lotan, Head-Gordon (2006)</a>. It has been implemented into APBS by Felberg and Head-Gordon.

By coarse-graining each molecule in the system into a sphere, the analytical model is able to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann efficiently and accurately.
