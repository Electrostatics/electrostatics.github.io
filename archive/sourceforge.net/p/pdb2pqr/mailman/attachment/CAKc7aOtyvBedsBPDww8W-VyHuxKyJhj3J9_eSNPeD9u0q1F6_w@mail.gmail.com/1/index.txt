Dear Sir/Ma'am

Thanks for your great pdb2pqr server. It's very helpful for me in study.
But I had meet a problem when I used it. For example, I uploaded the
1QD3.pdb file (attached in the enclosure), but the server cannot convert
this file to pqr file. So, I'm wondering if the pdb file needs to meet some
specific requirements.

Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks

Lizhen
