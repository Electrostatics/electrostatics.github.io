<div dir="ltr"><div>Dear APBS developers,<br><br>I may have found a bug in the pdb2pqr 2.0.0 release.<br><br>When processing the PDB id 1ETM either with the server or the standalone version, pdb2pqr fails to correctly rename the C-terminal CYS 17 residue to CYX. However this Cysteine is PATCHED to CYX as reported in the stdout.<br><br>Any guess why?<br><br>This is the command line:<br>pdb2pqr --ff=amber --ffout=amber --with-ph=7 --chain 1ETM.pdb 1ETM.pqr<br><br></div>Thanks for your answer!<br><div><br>Best regards,<br><br>Mat√≠as Machado<br></div></div>
