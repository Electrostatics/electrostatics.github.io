<div style="direction: ltr;font-family: Tahoma;color: #000000;font-size: 10pt;">I have been trying to use the PDB2PQR server to view the electrostatic surface of a protein, just practicing with a pdb coordinate file for GST, and every time I click &quot;submit&quot;,
 I get a message &quot;There was an error with your job submission&quot;, with no more information than that. &nbsp;I get the same error whether I upload the pdb file myself or supply the pdb ID, I also get it with different pdb files, and I get the same error on both Macintosh
 and Windows computers.

<div>Any help would be appreciated! &nbsp;Thank you</div>
