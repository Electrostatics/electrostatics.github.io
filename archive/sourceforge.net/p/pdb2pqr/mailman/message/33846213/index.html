  <td class="email-body"><pre>Sebastian,

In the case of HIS we donâ€™t have enough information to determine what force field name to use without at least one hydrogen available to us. In the assign only case we skip the routine needed to 1) Add missing hydrogens 2) Correctly determine which hydrogen to drop. We currently rely on the user to supply a hydrogen so that we can make a decision. In the future we may add a default behavior and this case wonâ€™t result in an error.

To work around this problem add an HD1, HE2, or both to each HIS residue.

Here is the logic used to map the presence of hydrogen to a force field name:

              if self.hasAtom(&#34;HD1&#34;) and self.hasAtom(&#34;HE2&#34;):
            self.ffname = &#34;HIP&#34;
        elif self.hasAtom(&#34;HD1&#34;):
            self.ffname = &#34;HID&#34;
        elif self.hasAtom(&#34;HE2&#34;):
            self.ffname = &#34;HIE&#34;
        else:
            raise PDBInputError(&#34;Invalid type for %s!&#34; % str(self))

Hope that helps!

Kyle

Subject: [Pdb2pqr-users] problem running pdb2pqr with the --assign-only flag

Hello,

I am trying to run pdb2pqr on a pdb file with the --assign-only flag and I receive the following error message:
DEBUG INFO: PDBInputError src/aa.py: 437
Error encountered: Invalid type for HIS C 30!


Changing force field does not help. The -v flag yields:

DEBUG INFO: PDBInputError src/aa.py: 437
Error encountered: Invalid type for HIS C 30!

I tried different versions of pdb2pqr but all yield the same error (currently running version 2.0.0), and no output is generated. I only want to assign radii and charge to atoms without adding new atoms or optimizing. Removing the --assign-only flag seems to work, but I don&#39;t understand why I cannot simply assign charges and radii.

Thank you very much in advance!

Subject: [Pdb2pqr-users] problem running pdb2pqr with the --assign-only flag

Hello,

I am trying to run pdb2pqr on a pdb file with the --assign-only flag and I receive the following error message:
DEBUG INFO: PDBInputError src/aa.py: 437
Error encountered: Invalid type for HIS C 30!


Changing force field does not help. The -v flag yields:

DEBUG INFO: PDBInputError src/aa.py: 437
Error encountered: Invalid type for HIS C 30!

I tried different versions of pdb2pqr but all yield the same error (currently running version 2.0.0), and no output is generated. I only want to assign radii and charge to atoms without adding new atoms or optimizing. Removing the --assign-only flag seems to work, but I don&#39;t understand why I cannot simply assign charges and radii.

Thank you very much in advance!

  <td class="email-body"><pre>Hello,

I believe I&#39;ve found the bug in the code. When the --assign-only flag is
set, the addHydrogens() routine is never called. Thus, when
myRoutines.setStates() is called in main.py (line 367 in main.py), the
setState() method of the HIS class in src/aa.py does not know how to
categorize the HIS residue. I don&#39;t know if adding the hydrogens before
calling this method, and then immediately removing them afterwards might be
right solution to this problem... Maybe just adding hydrogens to he
Histidines...
Please let me know if any of this makes sense.

Thank you in advance!

&gt; I am trying to run pdb2pqr on a pdb file with the --assign-only flag and I

&gt; I tried different versions of pdb2pqr but all yield the same error
&gt; (currently running version 2.0.0), and no output is generated. I only want
&gt; to assign radii and charge to atoms without adding new atoms or optimizing.
&gt; Removing the --assign-only flag seems to work, but I don&#39;t understand why I
&gt; cannot simply assign charges and radii.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you very much in advance!

  <td class="email-body"><pre>Sebastian,

In the case of HIS we donâ€™t have enough information to determine what force field name to use without at least one hydrogen available to us. In the assign only case we skip the routine needed to 1) Add missing hydrogens 2) Correctly determine which hydrogen to drop. We currently rely on the user to supply a hydrogen so that we can make a decision. In the future we may add a default behavior and this case wonâ€™t result in an error.

To work around this problem add an HD1, HE2, or both to each HIS residue.

Here is the logic used to map the presence of hydrogen to a force field name:

              if self.hasAtom(&#34;HD1&#34;) and self.hasAtom(&#34;HE2&#34;):
            self.ffname = &#34;HIP&#34;
        elif self.hasAtom(&#34;HD1&#34;):
            self.ffname = &#34;HID&#34;
        elif self.hasAtom(&#34;HE2&#34;):
            self.ffname = &#34;HIE&#34;
        else:
            raise PDBInputError(&#34;Invalid type for %s!&#34; % str(self))

Hope that helps!

Kyle

Subject: [Pdb2pqr-users] problem running pdb2pqr with the --assign-only flag

Hello,

I am trying to run pdb2pqr on a pdb file with the --assign-only flag and I receive the following error message:
DEBUG INFO: PDBInputError src/aa.py: 437
Error encountered: Invalid type for HIS C 30!


Changing force field does not help. The -v flag yields:
Parsed Amino Acid definition file.

DEBUG INFO: PDBInputError src/aa.py: 437
Error encountered: Invalid type for HIS C 30!

I tried different versions of pdb2pqr but all yield the same error (currently running version 2.0.0), and no output is generated. I only want to assign radii and charge to atoms without adding new atoms or optimizing. Removing the --assign-only flag seems to work, but I don&#39;t understand why I cannot simply assign charges and radii.

Thank you very much in advance!

Your insight was really helpful! Thank you very much!

&gt;  Sebastian,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; In the case of HIS we donâ€™t have enough information to determine what
&gt; force field name to use without at least one hydrogen available to us. In
&gt; the assign only case we skip the routine needed to 1) Add missing hydrogens
&gt; 2) Correctly determine which hydrogen to drop. We currently rely on the
&gt; user to supply a hydrogen so that we can make a decision. In the future we
&gt; may add a default behavior and this case wonâ€™t result in an error.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; To work around this problem add an HD1, HE2, or both to each HIS residue.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Here is the logic used to map the presence of hydrogen to a force field
&gt; name:
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;               if *self*.hasAtom(*&#34;HD1&#34;*) and *self*.hasAtom(*&#34;HE2&#34;*):
&gt;
&gt;             *self*.ffname = *&#34;HIP&#34;*
&gt;
&gt;         elif *self*.hasAtom(*&#34;HD1&#34;*):
&gt;
&gt;             *self*.ffname = *&#34;HID&#34;*
&gt;
&gt;         elif *self*.hasAtom(*&#34;HE2&#34;*):
&gt;
&gt;             *self*.ffname = *&#34;HIE&#34;*
&gt;
&gt;         else:
&gt;
&gt;             raise PDBInputError(*&#34;Invalid type for %s!&#34;* % str(*self*))
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Hope that helps!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Kyle

&gt; I am trying to run pdb2pqr on a pdb file with the --assign-only flag and I

&gt; DEBUG INFO: PDBInputError src/aa.py: 437
&gt;
&gt; Error encountered: Invalid type for HIS C 30!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I tried different versions of pdb2pqr but all yield the same error
&gt; (currently running version 2.0.0), and no output is generated. I only want
&gt; to assign radii and charge to atoms without adding new atoms or optimizing.
&gt; Removing the --assign-only flag seems to work, but I don&#39;t understand why I
&gt; cannot simply assign charges and radii.
&gt;
&gt; Thank you very much in advance!
