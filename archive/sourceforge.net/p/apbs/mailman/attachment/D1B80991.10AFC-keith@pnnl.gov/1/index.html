<div>Upon downloading APBS-1.4.1-binary.dmg, opening the disc image and moving the APBS folder to /Applications/: clicking the icon seems to simply be a path modification PATH=$PATH:`dirname '/Volumes/APBS-1.4.1-binary-osx-img/APBS.app/Contents/MacOS/apbs_term'`</div>

<div>That is correct. &nbsp;APBS is still a command line application, and as such is run from the terminal. &nbsp;The point of the icon is simply to provide a quick way to run APBS without having to require users to manage search paths and the like.</div>

Upon opening the folder and running the binary, I get an Illegal instruction: 4 error message. However, this was not a problem in 1.4.0<br>
<br>
</div>
I am running OS X 1.7.5 if that is useful. Any insight into getting this to work would be much appreciated.</div>

<div>If you are using OS X 10.7.5 Lion, then that is the cause of the problem. &nbsp;We didn't build the binary distribution expecting to support an OS older than a few releases. &nbsp;Right now, the only options that you have are upgrading to a newer version of OS X
 (Mavericks and Yosemite both work with this release) or to build a new release from source:&nbsp;https://github.com/Electrostatics/apbs-pdb2pqr/blob/1.4.1-binary-release/apbs/BUILD.md.</div>
