Hello --<br><br>We are pleased to announce the release of APBS 1.1.0.  This version of the software contains a number of new features including an <a href="http://nbcr.net/software/opal/">Opal-based</a> web services client to allow users to run calculations on remote computers and a new documentation site (<a href="http://apbs.wustl.edu/">http://apbs.wustl.edu/</a>) with an improved user guide and tutorials.  A complete list of new features and bug fixes is provided below.  <br>
<br>As usual, APBS can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/apbs/">http://apbs.sourceforge.net/</a> and help can be obtained from the APBS-users mailing list (<a href="../../../../../../../lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/apbs-users.html">subscribe</a> or <a href="../../../apbs-users/index.html">browse</a>).<br>
<br>Thank you for your continuing support of APBS.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>The APBS Development Team<br><br><br><ul><li>NEW FEATURES</li><ul><li>Moved APBS user guide and tutorial to MediaWiki</li><li>Added in support for OpenMPI for parallel calculations</li>
<li>Added in command line support for Opal job submissions (Code by Samir Unni)</li><li>Allowed pathname containing spaces in input file, as long as the whole pathname is in quotes (&quot;&quot;)</li><li>Documented &#39;make test&#39; and related features</li>
</ul><li>MODIFICATIONS</li><ul><li>Modified the function bcCalc to march through the data array linearly when setting boundary conditions. This removes duplication of grid points on the edge of the array and corners.</li>
<li>Clarified documentation on the IDs assigned to input maps, PQRs, parameter files, etc.</li><li>Updated tutorial to warn against spaces in APBS working directory path in VMD; updated user guide to warn against spaces in APBS installation path on Windows</li>
<li>&#39;make test&#39; has been reconfigured to run before issuing make install (can be run from top directory)</li><li>Removed tools/visualization/vmd from tools directory in lieu of built-in support in VMD</li><li>Path lengths can now be larger than 80 characters</li>
<li>Expanded authorship list</li><li>Added in &#39;make test-opal&#39; as a post install test (run from the examples install directory)</li><li>Added additional concentrations to protein-rna test case to better encompass experimental conditions used by Garcia-Garcia and Draper; this improves agreement with the published data</li>
</ul><li>BUG FIXES</li><ul><li>Fixed typos in User Guide (ion keyword) and clarified SMPBE keyword usage</li><li>Fixed typo in User Guide (writemat: poission -&gt; poisson)</li><li>Updated psize.py with to fix inconsistent assignment of fine grid numbers in some (very) rare cases</li>
<li>Fixed bug with boundary condition assignment.  This could potentially affect all calculations; however, probably has limited impact:  many test cases gave identical results after the bug fix; the largest change in value was &lt; 0.07%.</li>
