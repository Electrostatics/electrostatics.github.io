I Davide,

I would like to start to perform electrostatic calculation on Md=20
trajectories for a ion channel using APBS. Can you help me in this process?=
=20
and may be can you provide me the scrip that you use to plotted the=20
electrostatic binding energy as a function of he simulation time.

Thanks for the help.

Regards
