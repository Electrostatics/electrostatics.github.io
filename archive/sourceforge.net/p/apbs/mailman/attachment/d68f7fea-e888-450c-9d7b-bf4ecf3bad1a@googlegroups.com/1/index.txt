Hi 

I would like to calculate the contribution of a specific negatively charged 
residue of a protein in changing the electrostatic potential. 
For this, I was thinking of using APBS to do calculate the electrostatics 
of the WT protein as well as of a mutant protein in which the residue is 
changed to an uncharged aminoacid and take the difference. 
I was able to get dx files for both, but I am not sure how to take the 
difference as it is not clear to me how I can manipulate the "dx" files, 
other than visualizing it in Pymol. Any suggestion?
