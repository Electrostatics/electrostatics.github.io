Hi APBS developers,

I want to input customized dielectric constant map to define the molecular 
surface myself. I know that one should use the "read diel" keyword, but I 
don't understand the following description associated with the keyword:

"This command allows APBS to read the dielectric function mapped to 3 
meshes shifted by one-half grid spacing in the x, y, and z directions. The 
inputs are maps of dielectric variables between the solvent and 
biomolecular dielectric constants; these values are unitless. In general, 
this command will read dielectric maps written by write commands in earlier 
APBS calculations."


As I understand it, the dielectric constant is a scalar not a vector, so:

1. What is the meaning of the x, y, z-directional dielectric constants?
2. What the purpose of the one-half grid spacing shifting?


Thanks!
Nuo
