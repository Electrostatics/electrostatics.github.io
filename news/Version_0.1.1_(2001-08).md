I am slightly less pleased to announce the first bug-fix for APBS, version 0.1.1.  This fixes compilation problems that popped up for several folks, including:

<ul>
<li>Syntax errors with non-GNU compilers</li>
<li>Errors in the installation instructions</li>
<li>Installation of binary in machine-specific directory</li>
</ul>
