This is the initial version of the PDB2PQR conversion utility.  There are several changes to the various "non-official" versions previously available:
<ul>
<li>SourceForge has been chosen as a centralized location for all things related to PDB2PQR, including downloads, mailing lists, and bug reports.</li>
<li>Several additions to the code have been made, including pKa support via PropKa, a new hydrogen optimization algorithm which should increase both accuracy and speed, and general bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
We plan on continuing to improve PDB2PQR by refining the code, adding more advanced options, and encouraging collaborations with other utilities.
<p>Thank you for your time and interest in the PDB2PQR software.</p>
